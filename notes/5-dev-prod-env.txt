---- DEVELOPMENT VS PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ----

• Working with keys: Have two set of keys, one for development env and one for production keys.
    - Production keys can be kept remotely on Heroku servers & Dev keys can be kept on development machines.
    - Two seperate databases, Production (not to be messed around) & Dev (modifyable).

• Setup new Production env: (For more security use different account.)
    1. Set up new Production DB & User.
    2. Set up new Production Google API.
        - New Project: emaily-prod
        - Enable API: Google+
        - Create Credentials: OAuth client ID
        - Configure consent screen.
        - Set up Redirections in accordance with Heroku URL.
    3. Set-up keys.js file
        - Commit keys.js
        • In config folder:
            - dev.js  (DON'T COMMIT)
            - keys.js: decide credentials on the bases of env. ( COMMIT )
            - prod.js ( DO COMMIT )
        • When a server is deployed to Heroku, there is an existing env variable called NODE_ENV. This variable tells us weather we are running in production or dev env.
        - Setup version control correctly.
    4. Define all the environment variable on Heroku Server.
        - Go to Heroku.Com
        - Find the application for the app.
        - Go to settings.
        - Reveal Config variables.
        - Set variables
        - Hide variables

• When using OAuth always use https.

• Fixing Heroku proxy Issue:
    - Using relative path causes 'https' to drop out of URL & revert back to http.
    - Adding options to Google strategy:
        • proxy: true
