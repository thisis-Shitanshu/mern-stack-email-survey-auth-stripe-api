---- HANDLING PAYMENTS ----
• Billing Consideration: Rules of Billing
    • We are bad at security
        - Never accept raw credit card numbers
        - Never store credit card numbers
        - Always use an outside payment processor
    • Billing is hard
        - Possible to avoid monthly payment/mutiple plans?
        - Fraud and chargebacks are a pain.

• Stripe Billing Process:
    - Add Credit.
    - Call Stripe API and Render Stripe Form.
    - Details from the form are directly send to the stripe API.
    - Stripe sends back a token representing the charge.
    - We send token to our API: calculate total.
    - Our API confirms the charge was successful with Stripe.
    - Add credits to user's account.

• Developer step:
    - Install react-stripe-checkout
    - Working with API keys:
        - Server: config/dir
        - Client Side: Adding custome env variables.
            • REACT_APP_*
            • process.env.REACT_APP_
            • .env in root
    - Working with stripe checkout component
        - Create new component to handle checkout component.
            - Create a charge: npmjs.org & create a charge
                - install stripe npm to handle token from client side action.
        - Add new key to User model.
        - Make No of credit visible.
